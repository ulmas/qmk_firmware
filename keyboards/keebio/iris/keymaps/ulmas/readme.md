# Generated Keymap Layout

This layout was generated by the QMK API. You can find the JSON data used to
generate this keymap in the file layers.json.

To make use of this file you will need follow the following steps:

* Download or Clone QMK Firmware: <https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/>
* Extract QMK Firmware to a location on your hard drive
* Copy this folder into %s
* You are now ready to compile or use your keymap with the source

More information can be found in the QMK docs: <https://docs.qmk.fm>

## Build firmware

 [Base instructions](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/newbs_building_firmware?id=build-your-firmware)

* Navigate to root of `qmk_firmware`
* Run `make keebio/iris/rev2:ulmas`

## Flash firmware

The compiled binary is in the root of the `qmk_firmware` folder after the build step.`

Most of [these instructions](https://config.qmk.fm/#/test) describe manual flashing, but it can more easily be done using the QMK Toolbox instead.

### Enter bootloader mode

None of the methods to enter the bootloader mode described in the docs work. To enter the bootloader mode on the Iris hit the `RESET` keyboard key (check the mapping to find it).
